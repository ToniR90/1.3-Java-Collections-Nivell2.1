# Sprint 1_Restaurant_Project

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project involves creating a class called `Restaurant` with two attributes: `name` (String) and `score` (int). The objective is to implement the necessary methods to ensure that no two `Restaurant` objects with the same name and rating can be added to a `HashSet` created in the `main()` method of the application.

It's important to note that there can be restaurants with the same name but different ratings; however, there cannot be multiple restaurants with the same name and rating combination.
